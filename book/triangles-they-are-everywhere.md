# Triangles ... they're everywhere

It was a cool summer day. They walked along the Lybid embankment. This place can hardly be called an embankment in the traditional sense - externally it looked inconspicuous from the point of view of generally accepted aesthetics - an oblong ditch, locked between concrete blocks, stretching for kilometers, mainly among the industrial zone of Kiev, and periodically plunging into the ground as a collector. Now it looks plain. Everything that can be drained is poured into it. The nearby industrial zone aggravates this. On the walls, lined with concrete blocks, there are countless manifestations of the work of unrecognized artists. Homeless-looking people who slept next to fires in which garbage was burning complemented the picture. Ultimately, all this created an atmosphere of a true underground, which resonates with the events discussed later.

"You know, Ivan, although this place looks pitiful and not very biased, it has a fascinating history. I'm not particularly eager to retell historical textbooks. You can easily read about this yourself. I will only say that this place was mentioned more than a thousand years ago for the first time."

"Not a very rapid progress," Ivan rightly noted.

"I would say that this is a regression. Something gets better over time, something worse. And the most offensive thing, and it is tough to come to terms with it, is what becomes worse depends on us, what we understand, and what we can influence, having the necessary resources. And this causes extreme indignation of consciousness."

For most digitalsists, the space surrounding them, the world they live in, and their society needed to become better. Yes, the understanding of how to do this came gradually. The knowledge necessary for this was not given immediately, but a clear idea of it was formed over time.

But this was not the case for all digitalists. And that's okay. And that's even good. Utopias in their pure form are similar to dystopias, for they press with their absoluteness and necessity on freedom. The only absolute and necessity is freedom.

There are two principles in the human being, which are subsequently realized in the development of society as a whole. Destruction and creation. The creation of the new and the destruction of the old, of what was already. I could say that it will always be like this, but that would be too naive, considering how complex a being is and how slow and thorny way it is comprehended by human consciousness. But it can be argued, almost certainly, that it has always been this way, it is so, and it is not excluded that it will be so in the future.

The destructive forces inside a person are an integral part of a person. It's almost impossible to fight them. If you fight them, lock them inside - it will only get worse. The explosion cannot be locked inside a porcelain vase. It should take place in an open field, where it will have the least negative consequences. The explosion will happen anyway. The energy will be released. Nothing gets hurt. This is reasonable.

"Since we will not go anywhere from the destructive force inside us, it can and should be used, transformed into something that can be useful or at least not harm," said Mikroslav, stumbling over a half-broken bottle of cheap wine that was lying one step away from the side of the ditch in which the river flowed. 

Having received energy from the accidental kick of Mikroslav's leg, the bottle spun, fell into the fetid water, and sank to the bottom. It will be carried to the Dnieper during the following summer shower, and it will sink into bottom sediments for centuries.

"And what did that part of digitalsists do, in whom there was more internal destructive energy than could be kept inside?" the question, in addition to interest, contained notes of anxiety.

"Everyone was creating, in their own way. But the triangles were especially memorable."

"Just triangles?" Ivan asked with sincere surprise.

"Almost. Sierpinski triangles. They have become a widely recognized symbol of the movement. Sometimes, in waves, the spread of this symbol was like vandalism, although the Writer in every possible way condemned and did not encourage this, because in his opinion, it is destructive."

The first triangles appeared here - along the Lybed River. Then they began to appear on the fences of construction sites, on the asphalt, on houses. The triangles were drawn with paint and chalk. They were everywhere.

Digitists competed in sophistication: triangles were created in complex, three-dimensional, with the most bizarre colors.

The forces that tried to discredit the movement themselves organized raids. Various public objects were painted with triangles to create a negative image of the campaign and expose digitalists as marginals. But the only thing that this led to was that more people began to know about the movement.

The Writer only had to urge not to vandalize and draw triangles where permitted by law. Although he was beginning to be frightened more and more that the art book he had written, as he initially thought, had begun to come true. And although this scared him at first, he realized that he had written the book for a reason, and he had no choice but to bring the matter to a logical end. He is obliged to do what he must, what is inherent.

Sierpinski triangles were drawn everywhere, and this did not stop. Yes, there were waves when it was more active, but, in general, the process was continuous. And, most interestingly, it was not a seasonal fad, a trend that appeared brightly and disappeared just as brightly. From the moment they first appeared on the street, they have not vanished from them for many decades...
