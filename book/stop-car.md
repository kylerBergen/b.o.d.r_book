# "Stop car!"

One of the crucial meetings of Mikroslav and Ivan took place in the notorious zone of Kiev, the territory of Babi Yar, probably known to every Jew and not only. The dialogue about social justice and the movements they started in these places has a special symbolism.

It was not a very long walk, lasting two and a half hours. Still, it made Ivan quite clear how insane, merciless and destructive the waves of hysteria that periodically occur in societies of numerous emulations can be. Is it really just emulations? If we consider emulation as an almost complete copy of Reality, then, unfortunately, such mass hysteria can cover not only virtual worlds, and this is frightening. For one can laugh at absurdity and theatrical nonsense when they happen in the virtual world. But when it occurs in the Real-world - the phenomenon takes on the character of a tragedy.

Mikroslav and Ivan met at the exit of the "Dorogozhichi" metro station; it was the end of September. The most daring trees have already begun to turn yellow. The smell of autumn was already crushing, and clear weather emphasized it.

Ivan is a very straightforward person; he thinks in a simple and rather concrete manner. He doesn't use complex theoretical constructions where this is not absolutely necessary. Therefore, as soon as they got to the park and set off on their way to those places, he asked a simple and, most importantly, an urgent question.

"Look, here, about eighty years ago, tens of thousands of people were killed just like that, on far-fetched reasons. A whole nation, which has always been famous for a large number of major philosophers and thinkers, began with medieval cruelty to destroy their own kind based on poorly developed mythology. At the same time, less than ten years have actually passed from the beginning of the introduction of ideology into the masses to the murders. Could this happen now?"

Mikroslav, peering into the broken surface of the park road, along which they were walking, immediately answered:

"Quite. Moreover, this is likely to happen more than once. For society has no restraining mechanisms that could cut such mass hysteria at its root until it has acquired any significant force."

Mikroslav continued: 

"In one of the emulations, which practically does not differ from ours, society itself managed to create a global crisis in a few months, that, in total, in terms of consequences approached the losses of the First World War."

Ivan interrupted him:

"About what kind of "itself managing" are you talking? Weren't there any prerequisites for this?"

Mikroslav grinned and replied: 

"There was only one prerequisite - the hopeless stupidity of the masses. The crowd's intelligence is low, both 500 years ago and now - nothing has fundamentally changed since then. Separately, we are intelligent individuals, not even the best of us. An uncontrolled or mismanaged crowd is foolish. It destroys everything that is around; it destroys itself. And in one of the emulations, mass hysteria created a crisis under the most favorable external conditions.

As we do now, they periodically appeared in the mass media with companies defending another oppressed minority or fighting more or less far-fetched environmental problems, the fight against which often turned into a battle against windmills. That is, either such a problem was exaggerated, to put it mildly, or it had a slightly more than completely natural character. And, in fact, the human influence on its development was minimal. Yes, there were quite good initiatives, but they got lost in the stream of complete nonsense and were devalued.

During one of these companies, the society within that emulation took up arms against cars.

Ivan clarified: 

"They began to be indignant that the machines worsen the environment? So if ecology is fundamental to them, the transition to electric vehicles should not cause fundamental difficulties."

Mikroslava's smirk grew angrier and angrier. 

"The situation was much more interesting. They took up arms against the cars as such. Everything started as usual with a stupid and tragic incident."

On one of the central roads of Nice, there was a terrible accident, as a result of which a woman with a stroller was knocked down to death. The story began with two corpses. Yes, tragedy, but this is life. Nothing extraordinary, such tragedies sometimes happen.

But for an incomprehensible reason for everyone, the mourning and general anger for some reason did not subside after a few days. More and more examinations of road accidents were carried out. They were widely covered in the media. Although the real reason was apparent almost immediately: it was evening, the driver had not slept the night before and, due to the lack of sleep, lost control and flew into the sidewalk. At that moment, there was a woman with a child.

A week after the event, public anxiety not only did not subside but grew even more. Their faces were constantly spinning on television. The world's largest media interviewed the family and friends of this woman to collect information about her life. As it turned out, she was a teacher at a local school.

After two weeks, a local event gradually developed into an international one. An angry crowd demanded to limit the movement of cars in Nice as much as possible. Almost the entire center was prohibited from entering. In the rest of the city, the permitted speed was only 20 km / h.

Yes, I see bewilderment in your eyes. It seems to you that this is nonsense, but it all was growing. And for me, it's a mystery why the incident reached this magnitude. Perhaps this is because the action began in the spring, exacerbation of seasonal illnesses, you know... Perhaps there were no bright events like an earthquake or a hurricane with tens of thousands of victims for a long time, but the media decided to promote the event to the fullest.

At first, this nonsense just took up the airtime, and the Nice's inhabitants were standing for hours in traffic jams. And at the moment when the event began to subside, activists of all stripes joined in. All social networks are flooded with messages that it is necessary to restrict the use of road transport, as it is too dangerous for public safety.

People began to post messages with the content that it is immoral to use road transport, that every year in the world, more than a million people die from it, and tens of millions are seriously injured. Posters appeared with text like "You are a motorist - then you are a murderer."

After a while, the celebrities and public people joined in. Not using road transport was touted as a new fashion, as a part of "conscious people" life. There were many interviews about how celebrities gave up using this type of transport, how their lives changed for the better when they began to feel "more free and confident."

Except for the case that caused hysteria, the media also were broadcasting the stories of those whose relatives and friends died in the accident. They selected precisely those cases that responded with the maximum emotions from the crowd. They told their biography, moments from childhood, their dreams, and plans. A close-up showed the grieving of relatives.

They did not disdain to show the disfigured road accidents victims' corpses on simpler resources and at the late time of day. The fear of cars was growing among people. They were afraid to sit in them. They were afraid to be close to moving cars. They constantly imagined that the car would lose control and destroy them with its weight. People with an unstable psyche have developed severe psychological problems. On the highways, they had panic attacks; they felt extremely uncomfortable in such places.

Other topics began to disappear from the agenda in the media, social networks, and eventually - in the conversations of ordinary people. As a matter of fact, there was only one topic - the threat of the car to society. Just a month and a half later, it occupied about half of the airtime in the media. The madness did not subside. The madness was growing.

Ultimately, people caused an almost animal hatred for cars and those who drive them.

The inactive majority looked at all these attempts with irony. Still, many intelligent people had already begun to worry - stupidity began to grow and gradually take over people's minds. And most importantly, it slowly started to influence people's lives and change their way of life. Very slowly at first, but it doesn't really matter.

As usual, there should be some triggers in such situations, when the crowd finally loses its sense of reality, goes into madness, and society absorbs first hatred, then violence, and after a while, devastation. Quite a common triad, when the society is ruled by someone who has no expertise, the crowd is left to itself, and there is no personal responsibility for the final result - social development.

As usual, another tragic incident became such a trigger, which occurred three months after the tragic death of a teacher from Nice.

Obviously, many did not like, to put it mildly, and annoyed all this growing delusional movement. Motions began to appear that denied the movement that could be called "Stop Car!". The movement that fought with it could be called "Anti Stop Car!" As you can see, Ivan, nothing new, usual fuss. The only thing that can be noted is that the "Anti Stop Car!" movement has a lot more to do with common sense than the first one.

In general, there was rigging during the protests against restrictions related to the possession and use of a car. The movement of opponents of cars was much more aggressive and active, although a third of the total population supported it. During the rigging, the participants of "Stop Car!" began to crash cars and throw Molotov cocktails on opponents.

Riots engulfed several districts - it turned out to be a strong mess. People began to die. The second side began to flee, which was quite tricky in those conditions.

The police stood on the sidelines indifferently and did not intervene. They were afraid. Intervention threatened that the police would simply be destroyed on the spot, and the courts could ultimately be defeated in the same way if the participants were arrested.

The car of one of the "Anti Stop Car!" participants started throwing stones and Molotov cocktails. The visibility was low. He was driving down the street with a steep downward slope and lost control. As a result of negligence, knocked down four "Stop Car!" participants.

Society has gone mad. The final surrender of common sense to the hysteria of the crowd took place. Soon, stringent restrictions were introduced that wholly lost touch with the law, reason, and everything called civilized society. Freedom was executed.

Mikroslav and Ivan were walking through the abandoned buildings of an unfinished psychiatric hospital. In certain circles, among the Kiev informals, the place was very significant. It always greeted its visitors with gloom and created an atmosphere of extreme abandonment.

Mikroslav distracted from the main idea and commented on those gloomy structures in which they found themselves: 

"Look, Ivan, do you see these walls? These are the walls of an unfinished psychiatric hospital. As you can see, the hospital is unfinished, but the people for whom it was intended have not gone anywhere. They live with us; they walk among us. But perhaps it could help someone, someone who could cause harm to many people. Mikroslav's voice became a little lower and began to acquire an ominous pathos. Mikroslav decided to scare Ivan a little."

Ivan ironically turned to Mikroslav.

"Do you believe that psychiatry can help someone? Often it creates problems to cure you later. Earlier it was simply a tool to control objectionable individuals and dissidents. For example, in Soviet psychiatry, the term "philosophical intoxication" was even introduced. Overthinking abstract philosophical topics was not worth it; they could have locked you in a mental institution. And if these thoughts also contradicted the ideology of these years, then the mental hospital could be somewhere behind the barbed wire in icy Siberia."

Mikroslav, stepping over stones and rubbish lying on the floor of an abandoned building, said to this: 

"Of course, psychiatry will not help such people. People should be given a meaning, an idea, a deed, and not locked up in closed institutions. Of course, there are cases when help is needed, like when a man throws himself at people on the street with a knife. But this does not always have to be psychiatric help in the modern sense of the word. Yet, this true madness, true madness  are the events I just told you about."

With apprehension and a little frightened eyes, Ivan asked:

"So, how did that madness end?"

"All "Stop Car!" traffic lasted about one and a half years. If we take into account the complete absurdity of this action, the consequences were simply terrible."

In developed countries, it led to the fact that the economy due to the crisis caused by this movement shrank by more than 10%. Several tens of millions of cars were destroyed in pogroms because insurance companies could not fulfill their obligations. Crime has grown catastrophically. Medicine, as a result of the crisis, was unable to meet its obligations.

But these are, as it were, trifles. The world has become too interconnected, and the crisis in the developed countries has caused political instability in several large underdeveloped countries, resulting in millions of victims. There is no desire to describe this in detail. I can just say that the economy in countries with a total population of more than 200 million people was thrown back decades ago.

Ivan exclaimed:

"Looks crazy! People cannot so stupidly, senselessly, and quickly destroy the environment of their existence. This is ridiculous on their part. In addition, we are talking about developed countries. They have a high level of development of social institutions, the population is educated, for god's sake!"

Mikroslav smiled maliciously.

"Of course, they can..."

And then Ivan realized...the crisis that occurred in that emulation and the crisis associated with the coronavirus are too similar...

"We should definitely discuss this some more."

Mikroslav nodded. He had something to say about it. He was ready to say a lot about it...
