# Underpants under control

It was three o'clock in the afternoon. Mikroslav and Ivan met at the intersection of Kitaevskaya Street and Nauka Avenue. Mikroslav loved this place. This place gave a start to an interesting 7 km long route through forests, hills and ravines. Mikroslav loved to walk along this route at the first meeting with a person. This made him understand whether a person was right for him or not. This made it possible for a person to understand whether he needed communication with Mikroslav or not. After all, it is easy to keep the mask for an hour or two in a comfortable environment. When you first see a person, you meet with him on the outskirts of civilization, you walk with him for three hours along the forest rugged terrain where there are practically no people - it is much more difficult to hold a mask. Here two things start to play.

First, you must trust your interlocutor. If you have been sitting at an office chair for years, walking only at corporate parties, and going to rest in some fenced Egyptian hotel, the situation will break your pattern of behavior quite strongly. Periodicly appearing snakes and slippery mud on the paths along the numerous streams contribute to this.

Secondly, you must be trite interesting to each other. You should be comfortable with each other. In these three hours, you are one system. You are alone. There is no one else. The mismatch of interests and temperament is nowhere tragic as here (with the exception of family relations, of course). If there is a mismatch - it’s like a pebble that got into the running shoes while running - each next step will bring extreme inconvenience and an irresistible desire to throw it out.

It was mid-April. This place is especially wonderful at this time. Countless hills are grabbing flowers, three-hundred-year-old oaks feel young again. The life cycle of nature has been renewed.

They had just passed the old monastery and finally found themselves in the park. Ears were muffled by a spring concert of birds. Ivan ironically remarked:

"It's so funny that this whole ensemble of sounds in the forest is just the sum of sounds from creatures  engaged in hunting and sex."

Mikroslav answered with a smile:

"Yes, animals are easier with this, there is no such amount of meaningless set of rituals.You see food - catch it up and eat. Or vice versa. You can't guess. Well, either about sex - if you are a strong enough male, then problems with fertilization should not arise. People have created a bunch of rules for these simple and understandable processes. Yes, some are possible and necessary, taking into account the complexity of the human psyche in comparison with the animal and the complexity of the social structure. But they are needed in much less ammount, much less than there is now."

Unnecessary restrictions create tensions that destroy us. There should be just enough restrictions so that we would not be destroyed. If there is the right amount of restrictions - they have a healing power for the human community. If there are more of them than this number, society will negatively affect its members and, as a result, it will become dangerous for the existence of the society itself. If the number of restrictions is less than the required number, society will be destroyed. In general, measure is great power.

The state and society in their modern form are inherently totalitarian. They strive to control every area of ​​human life. Some of the most exciting objects to handle are your wallet and panties.

The most striking manifestation of the former is taxes. Nowadays, control over finances has become much broader. Ultimately, the state will know absolutely about every purchase you make, and it's terrible for you if it thinks that a "normal" citizen does not need this purchase.

As for the second, there are a vast number of restrictions. Some of them are legislative; others are manifested in the form of pressure from society. Fortunately, there are still fewer of them now than in some times. For example, not all sexual practices could be tried in the Middle Ages, and it's sad.

Now, however, there are also enough bans. And one of the funniest is the age of consent. Hysteria on this basis has reached enormous proportions. However, it might not exist at all. Even in the last millennium, the fact that there was sexual intimacy with minors was of no particular interest to anyone. The natural ability to conceive, that is, after the onset of menstruation, was a sufficient basis for marriage and intimacy.

Ivan began to interrupt:

"But look, a lot has changed since the Middle Ages. People began to live much longer, education was significantly lengthened, people began to work much later, and early pregnancy does not add health."

Undoubtedly, life has changed since those times, but this is not about demography but morality. Sex with a 15-year-old girl remained sex with a 15-year-old girl. Why was it normal at that time, but now you can get a sentence for such a thing as murder? In addition, there is a clear bias in the exaggeration of social harm from crime. A significant restriction of the individual's freedom is based on very relative and poorly grounded beliefs.

The forest path rushed up, the steepness of the slope grew, the breathing of both interlocutors quickened. Ivan made a reasonable remark:

"These restrictions are introduced because children are not aware of what is happening, and adults can simply use them sexually, even if, at first glance, they received "consent" for sex."

"You are embarrassed that children are being used sexually, and they are not aware of what is happening to them. Yes, it is reasonable. But at what age does this "awareness" arise? At 15, does a person understand? And at 16, 18, or 20? I guess it depends not so much on age but the level of personal development."

A huge number of people remain infantile, do not realize what is happening, and, in fact, are not responsible for their actions until adulthood. The person does not really understand what is happening, but he can have sex, marry, vote, own property, and drive a car, and no one is embarrassed. In any case, to such an extent as to restrict these people in their rights.

The age of sexual consent at the moment is not well-founded and is very conditional (in different countries, it can differ by at least 8 years). This is a figure that simply gives moralists the right to get into cowards and control the sphere that concerns only 2 people. I don't consider the extreme cases, but giving 22 years in prison for having sex with 17-year-olds (the Jennifer Fichter case) is immoral, inhuman, and, what scares me most, reduces the whole idea of criminal punishment to absurdity. And this is very dangerous for society as a whole. In our emulation, the hysteria of age-related sexual consent is growing thanks to the cries of moralists, but has not yet reached its peak.

Mikroslav and Ivan finally went upstairs and found themselves in an open space. There was a forest and a ravine on one side, from where they came, on the other, a high cliff, from which a view opened up tens of kilometers to the south and east. And even the dump on the left, a pile of rubbish, the height of which reached the height of a ten-story building, did not spoil the picture much. Sometimes the terrible complements the beautiful, in this case at least. They sat down - the ground had already warmed up enough; it was a pleasure to sit on it. Mikroslav continued:

"In another emulation, the story with the age of sexual consent degenerated into complete absurdity. This topic is closely related to relationships in which there is an age difference between partners. For some, pedophilia is when an 18-year-old sleeps with a 15-year-old. For others, when a 50-year-old sleeps with a 25-year-old. In that emulation, the age difference hype broke through the stratosphere thanks to moralists."

Changes in society take place in different ways. Some of them happen explosively, and the world around us changes dramatically in a matter of months. Others are more reminiscent of geological processes: they proceed slowly, may drag on for decades or even centuries, but this change will not become less significant. The events described here are somewhat of the second type.

The fighters for social justice and equality became furious gradually. When the right of everyone to be fat, not made up, with unshaven armpits was "won back", they drew attention to another area, which, in their opinion, was absolutely out of control.

Such characters are especially outraged by the well-known fact that some have privileges, while others do not, some have more resources, and others less. This thought kept them awake. Now I will not go into much detail about the nature of social inequality. This topic is the subject of a thousand works. I will only raise one aspect.

It just so happens that with age and problems and diseases, a person accumulates resources. I'm talking about resources in the general sense of the word - money, connections, knowledge, skills - anything that is of value to the individual and other people around him.

Well, our fighters drew attention to the fact that if an older person starts a relationship with a younger person, it is wrong, immoral, and generally does not correspond to the values ​​of "freedom, equality, and brotherhood." They thought how nice it would be to "cover-up" all this. They say people are illegally using their age and those benefits that it gives.

A campaign began to discredit inter-age relations. The howl came from various marginal feminist groups. Then he rose to a more general level, and the media began to write about it en masse. Materials were posted on social networks. A series of interviews began with low-quality artists who were "used in their youth" and "ruined their whole life." In short, nothing new. Cheap adaptation of #meToo.

Ultimately, any relationship with an age difference of more than 1-2 years began to be stigmatized, especially if the partners had different social statuses and the younger partner was subordinate to the older one.

A year and a half later, different countries introduced a law like the Permissible Difference in Age between partners, violations of which, like violations of the age of sexual consent, meant criminal prosecution of partners, especially the older ones. If the age difference was more than 5 years, such couples were persecuted. For couples with an age difference who got married before introducing this law, a humiliating verification procedure was assumed, where a special commission examined in detail their lives for compliance with "equality and social justice."

Ivan exclaimed:

"Absurd! What right do they have to interfere with private life, especially when it comes to the life of adult citizens?"

"Cases below the belt are too important to let them take their course. The state and society have always been interested in everything related to extreme emotions, altered states of consciousness, or procreation. Suppose the individual is allowed to control these matters on his own. In that case, he can begin to control other areas of his life, including the distribution of the results of his labor. All this threatens someone with the loss of power and material resources."

Such restrictions lead to ruined destinies and senseless, cruel rules of personal freedoms. Societies that create these restrictions deprive themselves of the fruits of unions of different ages and hinder the exchange of experience that existed for hundreds of years before these great "prohibitors" were born.
