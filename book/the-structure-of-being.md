# The structure of being

Mikroslav and Ivan were walking along a route they had known for a long time. From the metro station "Universytet" to "Pochtova Ploshcha" and further along the embankment to the metro station "Dnipro". For probably the hundredth time Mikroslav went along this route, but for him a lot seemed new. It does not matter that little has changed outside; the main thing is in something else. Something else was new.

Events in their lives unfolded rapidly. Ivan was confused. Mikroslav was creating. He was the creator of all the events that happened around. Ivan was a man who always wanted to understand things deeply, and this set him apart from many other people. The masses don't need depth. It is even disgusting to the masses. Ivan wanted to understand things deeply and accurately. But, as we will see later, this isn't so simple.

"What is being, where are we, and what are we?" asked the question Ivan, as if he was talking into an empty space.

"Your question is too broad to be answered. If we take the last part of it, then I have no idea at all about this. I have hunches only. Human thought has created thousands of theories on this score, but it is still impossible to give one specific answer. We can only try to formulate it. And again, the question is completely inaccurate."

As for being, the question seems to be easier, but only for me. I know the other side, I am on this side, so I can judge something. I can compare. If you see a difference in something, then you already have the opportunity to comprehend the essence. Comparison is an excellent method of cognizing being, but it is not the only one. It should be noted that in some cases it can even harm the cognition of the essence. The main thing is to understand its boundaries.

To simplify the scheme of being, we can say that there is Reality, and there are emulations. What is emulation? Call it what you want, a simulation of the universe or a matrix. In reality, we have learned to create virtual copies of the Universe of almost any level of complexity. We have learned to simulate worlds spanning hundreds of billions of light-years, containing countless universes and even more countless civilizations. There are trillions of these civilizations, each with its own history, its own path, and its own end, or ...

What is Reality? Well, this is a question that the creature that exists in the simulation cannot exactly answer. Including me. Because I now exist next to you. I am the same as you. Within this reality, I am as mortal as you are. I pay taxes as you do. I tolerate the imperfection of this world as much as you do.

"What does it represent in general terms?" Ivan asked.

Mikroslav replied:

"I don't know. I'm here, so I don't know. If I said that I know, I should have answered any question about Reality, but I cannot do it. True, those who are in Reality cannot do this either."

When you are a fish, you do not notice the water that surrounds you. When you are a person, you do not notice the air that you breathe. Everything is relative. We, who are here, in virtual reality, can perceive Reality simply as the physical source of our world. Reality is a source of boundless energy that feeds our world and enables it to exist. If we take the physical laws of our emulation and the physical laws of the real world, they have not many differences.

In fact, the only thing you need to know about the real world is that the civilization that exists there broke away in intellectual and technological development 300-400 years ahead and was able to create parallel or nested universes - call it whatever you want. There is at least one benefit from this - the limitless computing capabilities that we can get and use for our consumers.

How we learned to do it there, I really have no idea. I am not a physicist and I have not transferred much knowledge to this world. The bottom line is that in the Real Universe we create, let's say, a trillion parallel universes. We have access to them through a certain tool, some kind of computer. To create all of this the required volume is no more than an average power plant. Accordingly, in each of these trillion universes, we can create another trillion universes. But the most important thing is that the level of nesting of Reality, that is, physical laws, is not limited. Thus, in one Real Universe, one trillion parallel universes can be created (this is the first level of nesting), in each of them there is one more trillion universes (the second level of nesting), respectively, in each of the newly created universes - another trillion, and so almost to infinity - even a trillion times, even a billion times more than a trillion, even as many times as you like. We, in Reality, have the ability to create any number of universes and emulations of any level of complexity.

Ivan and Mikroslav already reached the embankment. It has been about 40 minutes since they began their conversation. It was a wonderful day at the end of August when it was cool enough, and it felt that autumn was not as far away as it seems, but at the same time, the sky remained clear, and all the colors of summer were felt.

Ivan was pondering a minute and then said:

"I got it. The energy of countless nested universes creates emulation. The amount of energy can be considered infinite. We can consider the detail of the emulation to be such that it approaches Reality. Indeed, quite sophisticated research is needed, and humanity must set up very cunning experiments to distinguish Reality from Emulation. The complexity of our world is very close to the complexity of the real world; the proximity is approaching one. What is the difference then?"

At that moment, Mikroslav stumbled over the mooring ring on the embankment, looked awkwardly to the left, towards the Dnipro river, and said:

"There are not many distinctions. If you take our senses as a basis, you won't find a difference in them. Even if you put on complex experiments at the level of the first quarter of 21st-century physics, you'll also find few differences. There are no differences at your level, you won't find them."

"That is, there is no distinction between emulation and Reality!" Ivan exclaimed.

"In fact, no. It is imperceptible," Mikroslav confirmed.

Mikroslav continued:

"Thus, there are technically two forms of being, Reality, and emulation. And if we can talk about the differences between them at all, then there are essentially two of them. First, Reality is the root cause for emulation, this is obvious: thanks to the computing power that exists in the Real World, we can simulate the virtual world, emulation. Second, fundamentally, we have one Reality. And we have as many emulations as needed, as well as parallel universes. Only they are products of the Real Universe. They are physical objects. To make a long story short, emulations are created virtually, via computers."

So, all the "magic" that later happened in emulations is based on a few simple ideas of: emulation, parallel universes, and several others. The main idea is that our world is not a true Reality. We are essentially a large, very complex program.

Ivan started asking more questions.

"Okay, in general, the system is clear. It is logical, as for a person familiar with computer science and cyberpunk culture. But is it so easy in Reality for everyone to create emulations? Isn't physical reality littered with all kinds of rubbish?"

"It's not important when the trash bin has almost infinite dimensions," Mikroslav answered with a smile.

Gradually, they approached the endpoint of their route. Mikroslav stopped and looked at the bridge. It was almost the sunset when the bridge lit up with white lights. In the distance, the sound of the subway was heard, on the right - the hum of the freeway. Mikroslav said:

"I don't know everything that happens in Reality. At the moment I am deprived of this knowledge, and it weighs on me."

My knowledge, skills, and abilities are not particularly different from the knowledge of the people you see around. And it motivates to work and achieve success, it gives interest in life.

When you have some kind of superpowers, initially a lot of capital or influential acquaintances, the game ceases to be interesting. It is interesting to complete the game from scratch to the top. This allows you to reveal those abilities that are inherent in your nature, to show that you are worth something.

Particular interest to the game is created by the fact that the game can take many decades, or rather, the length of the game is a human life. You have no idea whether you will achieve what you want or not, what you have planned, but the movement towards the goal and the opportunity to get what you want in the depths of your soul - ignites the body and soul with excitement, and most importantly - with action.

"In essence," Mikroslav continued "I am distinguished from others by several ideas that are embedded in my consciousness and a small amount of information that can be expressed in a text of 10-20 pages. There are no more differences between me and others. Not intellectually, not physically."
