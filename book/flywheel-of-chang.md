# Flywheel of change

This meeting took place on one of the southern outskirts of Kiev, near the dam, which is located on the edge of Korchevaty. Nearby could be seen the housing estate, which welcomes guests arriving from the south of the city. The following relatively large settlement in the direction of the south is Kozin. And it's funny.

The world, by its nature, is rather heterogeneous, at least visually. Wealth and poverty, intelligence and stupidity, will and lack of will, interest, and boredom - are intertwined in a knot that is usually impossible to untangle. Kiev is also heterogeneous. Wealthy neighborhoods alternate with slums and poor districts. Yes, this is not the slums of Rio, of course. There is no such poverty here. But there is a contrast â€” the contrast, for example, between the Kozin mentioned above and Korchevaty.

You, reading these lines in Moscow, Paris, San Francisco, or Cape Town, are already beginning to get bored and think, why do you need to know the local geography of the territory, which is located, perhaps, many thousands of kilometers from you. But I'll tell you. It's not about geography. A pair of Korchevatoe-Kozin exists in any country, society, time, etc. Now we are talking about the material aspect, but we understand that we are not only talking about this. We are talking about other, more systemic things. But back to our pair.

"How do you like the area, Ivan?"

"Okay, but I'd get out of here quickly to a safer place while my wallet is still there."

"I agree, but it is in such places that you understand something important."

"Rules of conduct in urban slums?"

"You're too tense today," Mikroslav said with a smile.

You see houses with cheap housing that are located on the outskirts of the city. The walls are often decorated with wall paintings. Under the stairs, a drug addict, brandishing a syringe, goes into one known nirvana at the corner of the house. Tasteless music sounds from old wooden-framed windows. It would seem that the environment is terrible, and people should immediately improve it, but they don't.

They don't, even if they have the physical ability to fix it. It is not tricky to conditionally put cameras at the entrance (if, of course, you are not afraid of Big Brother). It is possible to change your social circle in one or two years at any age. No one can forbid a person to start going to the gym, to chess, courses on something, or a hobby club, where he will find people contributing to his development.

It is impossible to make a million dollars in a year if you previously earned 500 dollars a month and lived among the same people. You live in a world where this is impossible. But in a year, it is possible to subscribe to a dozen magazines on business, economics and understand the main trends after this year. This information can help you choose the right area of application for your efforts.

If a person lives in a system, a social bubble, where something is impossible, then this means that something is impossible only in this system, and it may well be possible in another system.

"This is obvious, Mikroslav, but if a person lives in a closed system, like the one we are seeing now, then he can hardly come to this idea. He was born, raised, and lives in this coordinate system. Anything else is impossible for him. Yes, for people who live in Kozin just a few kilometers from this place, living in a house with an area of 500 square meters and a private pool is a daily routine. But for these people, buying even a simple apartment worth 50 thousand dollars is already a non-trivial task for a lifetime."

"This is true. And here we see a very interesting topic to think about. How to go from state # 1 to state # 2? The pairs of states can be anything you like. This can be a move from a one-room apartment to a house in an elite cottage village, the transformation of a poor country into one of the most advanced countries in the world, or a trip to the moon, or whatever else."

For digitalists in emulating the Writer, the philosophy of change has become one of the crucial pillars of the movement. The one who comprehends the changes will comprehend the world. And each member of the Brotherhood clearly understood for himself that Changes begin with a shift in consciousness. If you want to change the emulation, your position in it, and the environment surrounding you, you must change your consciousness. You must see the desired new state possible. And then it will become possible.

"Are you talking about wishful thinking? This is some kind of intellectual betrayal."

"Of course not. Apparently, the laws of emulation, ours or that of the Writer, do not imply an explicit change in reality through consciousness. There is an intermediary. And this mediator is called Action. Action is sacred. For only it brings changes. But the action comes from consciousness, and this should not be forgotten."

And, what is damn essential to understand - changes can be very unobvious for ordinary consciousness, and, even worse, they can be very slow. When you were at sea, you saw a cliff, which was not uniform in color. The ridge consisted of several layers, and each of them had its own color: grayish, brown, or white. For a person ignorant of this, the variety of colors means nothing. At best, he will simply pay attention; at worst, he will not notice.

For a knowledgeable person, these colors result from complex geological and climatic processes that could last hundreds of thousands of years and could end even before our species appeared on the planet. By the color of the rock layer, he will be able to tell you what the climate was several tens of thousands of years ago, when, of course, there were no constant meteorological observations. Yes, these judgments will not reflect the actual state of affairs one to one. But this is much better than nothing. Geology is the science of petrified alteration. And this is interesting. She can tell you about things that last much longer than you will last, how long your family will last, longer than your species will last.

You know, Ivan, sometimes a walk along the bottom of a ravine, where it can wash the fossils of past geological eras, can turn the inner world much more than the most inspiring sermon of the most charismatic preacher, more than the most sophisticated religious or philosophical book.

You look at the seashell in your hand, and you realize that, firstly, a couple of tens of millions of years before you, there was some living creature that breathed, moved, and multiplied - lived, in general. Secondly, even though the nearest sea is more than four hundred kilometers, there were once miles of seawater above you, and waves splashed on the surface of this body of water. And you are standing under these waves and millions of years after they have finished splashing.

"Mixed feelings. On the one hand, it admires. On the other hand, it is sad how little the figure of a person is."

"I disagree with you that the human figure is insignificant. He is the only creature on this planet and most likely the only creature within a radius of many light-years that can understand the universe's complexity around him."

They walked for a long time, along country roads, through meadows, and finally came to him. He stood on the shore of a nameless bay. Stood for a long time. A very long time. As for human life - infinity. For everything that came before you and everything that will come after you is, in fact, infinity. And it would seem that this infinity has nothing to do with you, but this is not entirely true. The consequences of our actions can go far ahead, into this infinity, thus connecting you with this infinity.

So, where did Mikroslav and Ivan come? To the huge oak, which was called the Oak on the Blue Water among local historians.

This oak has stood here for about 500-600 years, that is, the acorn from which it grew (although, why are we talking about the acorn as something separate from the oak: it is a part of the oak) fell to the soil no later than the 16th century, perhaps even in XV century.

Over these 500 years, the power in this territory has changed an insane number of times. The name of the state has changed a dozen times. Probably, the relief around this place even changed a little. And the oak stands. It does not care a straw.

Sitting on the root of an old oak tree, Mikrovslav began:

"One of the essential philosophical topics that worried the fraternity members were the topic of cause-and-effect relationships. Understanding this topic is very important to manage change. In the first edition of the book, very little was written about this topic. Nevertheless, everyone understood that awareness of cause-and-effect relationships was the key to understanding change."

Now I can tell you that although a lot can be explained through a set of cause-and-effect relationships in emulation, one must understand that because the world is very complex, sometimes cause-and-effect relationships are inaccessible for understanding due to their number and complexity. But this is not a reason to stop trying to understand them.
