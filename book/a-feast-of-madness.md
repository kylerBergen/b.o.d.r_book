# A feast of madness
The next meeting took place a few days later. A serious struggle ensued between cold and warm, almost summer days alternated with very significant cold snaps. Their meeting just fell on a cold day.

There is nothing funny to discuss the stupidity of people being among them, so they chose a small cafe located in the basement on Shevchenka Boulevard. A vaulted brick ceiling, unobtrusive music and a quiet audience set up a conversation.

After they sat down at a table and made an order, Ivan rhetorically remarked, unobtrusively continuing the theme of the previous meeting:

"You know, sitting here and looking at the intellectual faces of people, it is hard to believe that they are part of all this madness. When a person gets into a crowd, something happens to him, especially if it's an online crowd."

Mikroslav replied to this:

"Yes, the crowd is truly insane and ready to destroy everything that it sees around without a second thought. You see, people who screeched with excitement 600 years ago during the execution in the market square have not disappeared. And the fact  they have now been given phones and computers has not fundamentally changed anything, except the consequences can be much global. For now there are social ties that are too close. This was not the case before. A person who lived in the 15th century in Prague often could not have the opportunity to communicate with a resident of Smolenko and this was an insurmountable obstacle. Today this problem can be solved in 10 minutes - to find and communicate with a stranger from a completely different continent. In this respect, the world has really changed.

You saw a colorful scene of madness during the coronavirus hysteria. Everything was perfect here - both the inadequate harsh reaction of the state to a disease that did not even reach the Spanish flu of 1918, not to mention the plague and cholera, if we talk about the mortality rate, and the unbridled screams of the crowd. This social, I emphasize, social, non-biological phenomenon will be studied for a long time by specialized institutions.

Ivan sadly asked:

"And how did it come about, who needs it? Why didn't the defense mechanisms in the society work? It seems there were already similar psychoses and they ended badly..."

"You know, I don't have a definite answer to this question. Both I and the Writer have rather limited information. We can in fact judge only from open sources. Still, it's enough for basic conclusions. I don't believe in conspiracy theory, chipping and the like. It's too unlikely. Could this virus be of artificial origin, or is it possible that it was released from the laboratory by mistake? This is more likely, but we may not know about it, and it is no longer important. This will not particularly affect the course of the virus. Did someone take advantage of this situation? Yes, definitely. Has the danger been hyped and exaggerated? Of course."

The virus, or rather the panic caused by it, is beneficial to too many actors of this geopolitical performance. When the value of an asset is rapidly falling, and you have the opportunity to buy them, the situation is beneficial to you. When you are a state that wants to control its citizens as much as possible, then the situation when you can force them, under the threat of a fine or imprisonment, to install a program that will track their location and social contacts - the situation is very beneficial for you.

But a state without a crowd, that is, a people, is empty. The crowd itself spurred the introduction of draconian laws. In a number of countries, where there was no intention to impose severe restrictions, the crowd wanted to be limited, locked at home like mad dogs.

Restrictions and control were perceived by the crowd as caring for them. And I'm afraid that in some cases it will be simply impossible to fix it. One can only give an opportunity, but it is impossible to force one to be free. The crowd will again look for a new shepherd and it will be very lucky if he takes care of it, which is not so often. It is amusing how the crowd itself controlled whether other restrictions were enforced or not. It was not customary to publicly even doubt this madness. And when all the adults around you and they, in one impulse with foam at the mouth, believe in this nonsense, then many simply did not have the willpower to somehow resist it.

For a significant mass of people to go against the ruling ideology, to go against trends, to be alone is worse than getting cancer of the 4th degree and suffering in pain - the crowd can accept this (although reluctantly, because this is also out of the ordinary), but apostasy is not. However, there is no need to force them to be different. Everyone should get what they want. There is a possibility only of aт insignificant directing. Or creating a new trend. More reasonable.

Masses and smartness are, by their nature, concepts lying at opposite poles, but propaganda suggested something else. I was especially amused by the myth about "conscientiousness". All social networks, even advertising, have been obsessed with the idea of ​​"conscientiousness."

“Celebrities, the color of the nation, those who move this society forward - they sit like everyone else at homeю Who are you to break the rules? Do you consider yourself better than others? Where is your consciousness?!?" - the words were buzzing in the networks. There was "conscious delivery" and "conscious pizza making". And there was more "consciousness" inside the pizza than inside the people who believed this.

People were taught that if they sit for two months without leaving the house on their greasy sofa, then they will save the planet. And people really believed it. You sit like this, drink beer on your dirty couch, watch TV, degrade - but by doing this you save the planet! However, to give meaning to those who do not have it is also to some extent noble.
