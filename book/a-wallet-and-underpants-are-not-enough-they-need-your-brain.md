# A wallet and underpants are not enough. They need your brain

The end of April was hot in summer. The temperature set new records. The sun heated the asphalt, and everyone felt the heat, unusual after winter, which caused only one desire - to hide in the shade, to get away from the heat. But the heat was omnipresent. You can't get away from it so quickly. It can only be lived.

Mikroslav and Ivan agreed to meet in the lobby of the Dnipro metro station. This is one of the least busy metro stations, and people are scarce here if you do not consider the rare station employees.

Mikroslav arrived a little earlier. He sat down on a wooden bench. The box of grass was lightly crushing the pocket of his black trousers. In his country of residence, he faced only administrative punishment for such an amount of cannabis, which consisted either in a fine of about $ 30, or in 15 days in a jail.

And this worried him more than the inconvenience of having a box in his pocket. He did not want just to pay $ 30 to the state or donate 2 weeks of his life to the state. This will not be of any use to him or to the state. The box in his pocket is his own business. He decided to use the herb at the moment, and this is his moral right. He did not plan to crash after a shop window, puke on the street, or commit any other crime. He just wanted to relax his brain in whatever way he saw fit. And this should not concern the state.

Ivan came up.

"Come on, we have an interesting conversation today."

They left the metro and went to the underpass to go to the dam towards the Dnieper. They walked the route from Pochtovaya metro station to Dnipro metro station many times, but this time went from Dnipro station to Patona bridge. And there was one difference, besides, the locations were different.

On the one hand, this part of the Dnieper embankment is quite overgrown with grass, reeds, and various vegetation. On the other hand, the wall that separates the lower platform of the embankment from the road is lower than in the Postal Square area. And this creates a certain discomfort, although there are much fewer people there than on a similar route to the Dnipro metro.

Certain types of discomfort force you to be more attentive and act more actively and faster. This discomfort is sometimes essential for all of us.

They walked about a kilometer and sat down on the steps of the embankment. A weak wind hit them in the face. They felt free. Mikroslav pulled out a small bong from his bag, and after 3 minutes, the relaxing smoke got into the nostrils of our travelers.

Mikroslav lit a cigarette, Ivan refused - and it's cool when you do what you want, and the other doesn't do it because he doesn't want to do it. Freedom, true freedom, is one of the most valuable resources in the universe. But it is not given by itself. This is not a default option. It must be earned. It must be gained. And sometimes it is much more challenging to do it than to make money for a good car or apartment in the center. In general, the scheme for obtaining benefits is clear. The procedure of obtaining freedom is much more complicated and not obvious. This is a whole way of life, a path.

After drinking water, Ivan said:

"Although lighting this potion completely contradicts my beliefs, I am against senseless prohibitions. Why to hide when you can not?"

"Right. True, I would say that these bans are not only meaningless but also dangerous. They harm society. They harm the state. They harm individuals. Restrictions on drug trafficking are needed only by regulatory authorities and illegal drug manufacturers. It is also possible for individual politicians and the media to create unreasonable hysteria around the subject of the issue and then ban it."

Of course, bans are necessary, but there should be a minimum number of them, as little as possible. Anything more significant starts to hurt a lot.

We are taught from school about the harm of drugs. The media are fanning horror stories. Talking about drugs neutrally or positively in public space becomes socially unacceptable and dangerous for a career.

Yes, there are hazardous substances. But their influence has long been known. To accept them or not is a personal choice for everyone. Alcohol is more dangerous than some drugs regarding addiction and health effects, but it is legal. The primary source of harm from drugs is that they are banned.

Ivan looked with surprise at Mikroslav.

"Is it the primary source? Aren't drugs dangerous because they can destroy the body and disrupt social life to one degree or another?"

"Yes, that's right. The drugs themselves are not nearly as dangerous as the interest of others in your substance use. If you are not hired because your tests showed the presence of drugs, will you feel better? The deprivation of the opportunity to earn money, the lack of the chance to use potent substances in comfortable conditions, and freedom from persecution by the state are the primary harm of drugs."

If you go with a truck of alcohol, then the state will have no questions for you, and if they find a backpack of herbs, you can spend many years in prison - the time during which you will lose your health, the time during which the state received nothing from you - moreover, it will support you, poorly. The power of the impact of alcohol and cannabis on consciousness is very close, but if you take the effects on health, then this is a rhetorical question of what is more harmful.

Concerning drugs, the repressive nature of the state is especially pronounced. This is an excellent example that the state can prohibit you from doing something, even if it concerns only you, and if you dare to violate the prohibition, it will take your freedom away. And if you take into account the ubiquitous nature of the state - that is, in other words, you can't get away from it - the situation is very dystopian. The absurdity expressed in the state's drug policy and the nonsense described in the best works of the dystopian genre are similar. Moral categories are relative things. In my understanding, senseless prohibitions, for violation of which they can take almost everything from you - there is evil. True evil.

Ivan had a puzzled face. The last thing Mikroslav said was too abstract and far from life for him. The bong was too close to him ... 

"Mikroslav, could you tell in more detail how it works in real life?"

"Well, look, there are drug users, and there are those who distribute them. This is how it was. This is how it will be. You can't get away from this. No matter how strict the laws are, drugs are used and sold in every country in the world."

Some substances are highly addictive, and a person will go to great lengths to get the next dose. More precisely, they will go to any lengths to get it. A product that falls under a ban automatically becomes more expensive than without such a ban. Especially if someone needs such a product, since consumers of such substances do not always use it due to a good life, the contingent is sometimes very frostbitten - do not be surprised that you were banged for a couple of tens of dollars. There would be no prohibition - the drug would be worth a penny compared to current prices, and the vast number of crimes committed now would never have happened. The ban on drugs pushes people from marginalized groups to commit crimes, rob, and sometimes kill. And these people are not going anywhere. It is much easier to remove any restrictions.

Move on. We have a first-year student. He has no money, his parents are poor, but he wants to take a walk. So, he falls into the mortgages. That is, he begins to distribute drugs by making the so-called "stashes". Does he bring evil to society? From my point of view, no, he helps people to relax. He does not force them to use drugs. What happens next? He is caught and goes to prison for several years. He loses the opportunity to develop and get an education. Gets a criminal record. After being released from prison, he has minimal chances of getting a regular job in our society. While in prison, he adopts the values and skills of that environment. Leaving prison, he is more likely to commit more and more crimes. Was it any benefit to society that it sent a person to jail for selling weed to people? No, it hurt both itself and this person.

It is especially funny that at the same time, there are countries where drugs are partially legalized and countries where they are completely banned with significant penalties for their use and especially distribution. That is, for the same action, you can legally receive either money or 5 years in prison. Moreover, among the countries where they are legalized, there are also very highly developed countries. Thus, prohibitions look especially silly and meaningless.

We go to the higher level. Since drugs are much more expensive than they could be - because of their illegal status, the criminal world has enormous amounts of money that it can use to commit other crimes, bribe politicians, which ultimately leads to discrediting the entire system state.

The number of prohibited services and goods should be minimal because the prohibition is meaningless - they will still exist, and the prohibitions themselves give rise to something that destroys the state and society.

The sun began to go down, beyond the horizo. Despite the heat, it became cool during the day. And they went to the Paton Bridge, then took a taxi and each went home in his thoughts. There were many thoughts. They were complex. But there was no escape from them. They both understood that people should be given the freedom to control their bodies. They knew that sooner or later, it would happen. But they also knew that this would not happen soon, but the path to this must be started.
