# The structure of being. The Writer

Ivan was driving home in a depressed state. He didn't understand what was happening. This was pressing on him. However, what else could you expect from talking to Mikroslav? Mikroslav knew how to be tensive. On the other hand, after talking to him, better understanding and clarity appeared, clarity that inspires and makes life deep and meaningful, despite the fact that in itself it is a complex thing, and sometimes very difficult to achieve. Sometimes good things happen with a certain amount of effort.

The feeling of this clarity can be compared to the feeling when you climb the hills that lie in the middle of the city, and look at this city from above. Being inside the city, you do not immediately understand its complexity, its size, you see only a small limited area that is available to your eyes - be it a section of the street, a park or a table of your favorite cafe where you like to drink coffee. It is a part that is infinitely less than the whole. This part is in front of your eyes. This part is in your hands. This part is on your mind. It is available to you.

Is the whole available to you? It can be available to you, in essence, just as a part of the whole is available to you. It is not difficult to gain access to the whole, but you still need to make an effort, you need to systematically make an effort, and then you will get it. The most important thing here is not the tension with which you get an understanding of the whole, but the systematic, periodic efforts with which you begin to understand the whole.

If you do the right thing over the weeks, months and years that add up to decades, you will climb your mountain, the one you want. And you will see the city, you will see the whole city and you will do it in one go. But this does not come immediately. The path to the whole is long. But this path is pleasant. This path is for you, this path is for those who are important to you. But this is not the path for everyone. The whole is a treasure. And what is the essence of this treasure? The value is in exclusivity, in the inaccessibility for everyone.

Ivan got off the underground and took the high-speed tram at "Vokzalnaya" station. Standing at the bus stop, he realized that this was just the beginning. This is only the beginning of his understanding of being. And with a fairly simple scheme, at first glance, there are still details that make this picture almost grotesque, but no less perfect for that. How so? Understanding did not come immediately.

Ivan could not resist and wrote to Mikroslav with a proposal to meet. Mikroslav appeared only about five hours later and answered with his consent. Mikroslav did not get enough of walking near the water and therefore suggested taking a walk along the Obolonskaya embankment.

They met a day later on the platform of the Minskaya metro station and walked unhurriedly to the embankment. Wide avenues and Soviet panel architecture created an atmosphere of absolute everyday life. Everyday life is something in between, something that does not get out of the way of life. It does not set you up for important conversations and crazy plans. The absolute everyday life completely absorbs you. And when you try to dream of something great or at least abstract, you experience a feeling on the verge of physical pain - this is a feeling of awkwardness. Everyday life says: "Go to work, don't dare think, be ordinary."

Being ordinary was not something that suited Mikroslav and Ivan, and those who shared the ideas expressed by them. Against the background of the oppressive atmosphere of everyday life, where they found themselves, their conversations were on the verge of those of urban madmen. However, for them it did not matter at all, they were on the other side of everyday life, although they were simultaneously inside it.

They walked through the courtyards and already approached the embankment. The smell of the water was difficult to ignore. A little wind played with their hair.

"Do you have a lot of questions for me?" Mikroslav asked, looking at the floor.

At the same moment, he saw the coin. Deciding to replenish his piggy bank, he reached for it and after a couple of seconds grinned - the coin was issued in the year of his birth. Although its current age was gradually approaching 30, it is still well preserved, actually, as Mikroslav is.

Ivan's thoughts were confused, the situation was further complicated by the fact that it was hot. Ivan began with simple and almost childish questions. Although this is inaccurate. Not all children ask themselves questions about what emulation is and how to live in it.

"How many emulations can be in reality?"

Mikroslav answered this:

"Well, within the framework of this emulation, the answer to this question will not bring you any significant benefit. This is idle knowledge, but I will not go away from your question and say that their number can tend to infinity. There cannot be an infinite number of them, because, as you understand, infinity is not a number and, in general, it's an object that is complex enough not only for ordinary perception but also for any perception at all. Infinity is an abstraction. But for ease of understanding, you can consider that there is an infinite number of them."

Simply because whatever number you name, in reality, you can create the same number of emulations plus one more. Look, in our world, now, there is a huge number of events and options of the situations' development. And for each of these situations, you can create a universe in which this event will happen a little differently, and all other events will remain unchanged. Although, of course, over time, this changed event will affect others as well.

And all this happens because Reality has an infinite source of energy, that is, no matter what source of energy or computing power (simplified, computer), you would order yourself - you can get a better resource at your disposal. The mechanism is completely incomprehensible, but its nature is truly admirable.

The wind became harsher. Ivan looked awkwardly at Mikroslav and asked another question, more daring:

"Are we able to, in our emulation, create other emulations by ourselves? Considering, the source of energy is endless..."

"You answered your own question, but I must admit, it is not so easy. More precisely, it is very difficult. Civilization must be at a very high level of development. If people begin to waste their time so thoughtlessly as they do now, then we will have five more centuries to go to this stage. If changes begin, then, perhaps, somewhere an order of magnitude less, that is, during one human life. But then people should really desire it."

They didn't notice as they approached the caisson of the so-called Stalin tunnel. This was a huge concrete structure, much higher than human height, but, at the same time, lower than the houses that are nearby. It resembled a Christian temple: not too large so as not to oppress a person with its size, and had a specific shape. The object was abandoned and has become a "canvas" for street artists. As it happened, it created an atmosphere for the right conversations.

Ivan began to formulate a new question, based on the knowledge he received from Mikroslav:

"Look, it turns out, there is a Reality, there can be countless emulations. Emulation is just a copy of the universe, created on a very powerful computer. Can emulations interact with each other?"

At this moment Mikroslav was standing inside the tunnel. He smiled. As he began to speak, a hum from his voice spread throughout the tunnel:

"We are gradually approaching questions, the answer to which is essential and can affect life. The short answer is simple - yes, they can. But the devil is in the details, and the interaction between them has its own special character. We'll talk more about this since several issues are very important not only from the point of view of pure philosophy but also from the point of view of everyday life."

Emulations interact with each other, they exchange information, however, this does not always happen in an obvious way. Most often it happens implicitly and to the extent that it is necessary, following the logic of the development of one or another emulation.

Moreover, based on the nature of emulation, an interaction between emulation and Reality is possible. But this happens rarely and not in all emulations. It is interesting to observe the processes from the outside. Although at first people used emulations to realize all their possible fantasies, changing the copy of the real universe as they liked, then they stopped doing it, but not because of moral convictions, no - they just became purely humanly bored.

Nothing forbids, in Reality, to create an emulation of the universe, of any kind, and do whatever you want with it and its inhabitants. This is what happens in general. The thing is that emulations, in which there is interference from Reality, are the minimum amount. There are even fewer emulations with their own exotic laws, which are significantly interfered with by Reality. In addition to boredom, this is also explained by the fact that the number of emulations is actually unlimited when the Reality and the number of people are limited, so there are not enough people for all emulations. The situation is similar to one with nested emulations. Many emulations have been created on an experimental basis. The existence of a significant number of them was forgotten.

If we talk about our emulation and its interaction with other emulations, I will tell you about one interesting case, about a not very obvious but vital connection.

Then Mikroslav remembered that he had not eaten normally for eight hours, and the conversation was going to be a long one and invited Ivan to have dinner in a pizzeria. Ivan happily agreed. To the pizzeria, they went in silence. Everyone was alone with their thoughts. Ivan was considering what he had heard. Mikroslav, on the other hand, was thinking about how he would reveal the next idea because it is defining and means a lot, both for them and for people whom they will never see, never hear, and whom they will never get to know live.

An hour and a half later, when they had already quenched their hunger and drank beer in a calm atmosphere, Mikroslav continued:

"Now, I wanted to talk about one figure that will play a certain role in emulation, which is very close to us in a sense. I will speak in theses because I want to sleep, but I have to say about it. Writer. He will write a book. Initially, he thought it was just a figment of his fantasy. Later, people and events will be layered around this book, and the primary fantasy will take on forms that are very far from it. At some point, he realizes that this book is more real than he might have thought at first. That it was real before he started writing it, despite his belief or lack of it at the beginning. It no longer depends on his desire or will. It is this that no longer depends. It is already living its life."

"Stop-stop, you somehow talk too quickly, too much information in such a short period of time," Ivan interrupted him.

"You and I, like everyone else, have very little time. Time is too valuable a resource to waste. It should be either beneficial or enjoyable.

Imagine Ivan that you are someone who is in Reality. There you already have almost everything. You have access to the latest technology. But you feel that you are missing something. Something is missing due to satiety, limitations, and understanding of something genuine, valuable. You create a virtual universe and put yourself there, without any special things in it. You have the same as the majority has. You have only a vague feeling about Reality..."

"Are you saying that the Writer is the creator of some emulation, including ours?"

"I don't know. But he clearly has some connection with it."
