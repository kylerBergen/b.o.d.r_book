# They will fight with us

It was a sultry June evening. Podol. Music and the smells of alcohol ignited excitement everywhere. Mikroslav and Ivan met in Celentano. They sat down near the window and looked tiredly at the people passing by. The sound of a tram passing by added a memorable atmosphere to this summer evening.

Mikroslav and Ivan rarely talked just like that about anything. They rarely shared the details of their daily activities. They understood that they had met for a reason, and every day of their friendship should be spent profitably. Days are few - there is a lot of unfinished business. They understood that the world of their emulation is vital for people living in an entirely different emulation. Those hours-long dialogues that they spend their leisure time in can significantly help people whom they will never see, never hear and who will never shake hands.

In essence, they do not owe anything to these people, but they understand their responsibility to these people. They have a sense of community with these people. Therefore, Mikroslav and Ivan meet again and again because they can't have it any other way.

Ivan began:

"The movement that you described at the last meeting is fascinating. On the other hand, didn't society, the state, have any questions about it? After all, the brotherhood operated in parallel with the existing system. Although it formally did not violate the laws, it challenged the current order in society, moral norms, and what was generally accepted in society."

They brought pizza and a bottle of semi-sweet red wine from the Alazani Valley. Mikroslav took the first sip and said with a smug smile:

"Yes, of course, there were questions. And, even though the brotherhood almost completely operated within the framework of the law, due to the scale of the movement and the speed of its growth, and the increase in the number of participants, it began to attract the attention of people, not only well-wishers."

There were many intelligent people in the movement, many energetic people who were full of passion and who, purely for fun, put a lot of effort into developing the brotherhood. They knew how to make it popular and exciting among those who needed fraternity and those who needed fraternity. As a consequence, at specific points, growth was explosive, despite periods of calm.

And when a group of intelligent and energetic people begins to do something that is not invested in the system, it causes fear in the authorities, existing social institutions, and various public organizations.

The word "sect" gradually appeared in the headlines. Indeed, in the brotherhood, there are some signs of religion in the general sense of the word. Yes, this is a worldview system, a particular way of life. Still, the media and society put something different in the word "sect" than just a group of people living according to a new philosophy.

Although there was nothing special to present to the digital reality fraternity: they did not take the apartments (as one of the leaders joked - this is a dreary business, and most importantly - ineffective), mass or even single suicides did not commit - horror stories about the digital movement began to appear.

Since it began in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, rumors began to appear about the enemy's origins of the movement - they said they were FSB agents. In Russia, on the contrary, they said that this was a dangerous branch of the philosophy of transhumanism. The movement was created under the influence of Western special services to powder the consciousness of citizens and turn us into "biorobots deprived of real spirituality and humanity."

Humor is a critical sign of intelligence. It was possessed and skillfully used by members of the brotherhood. They responded with sarcasm and irony to public accusations.

The Digital Reality Brotherhood loved to get together and hold demonstrations, including in Kiev, the Writer's homeland. In the beginning, offline meetings included up to several dozen people. Online activity was more active, especially in the early days. Later, after some time, something very significant happened.

It was the month of October. The Kiev center for digital technicians announced a meeting of digital technicians. Members of the brotherhood were summoned from all cities of the country. Everyone was invited: both members of the brotherhood and those simply interested in the topic and who thought that our reality is not what it is.

Sophia Square was chosen as the meeting place. Even though the online movement included more than ten thousand people, the organizers thought that there would be at most a hundred or two.

About five thousand people came at the appointed hour. Since members of the movement were often called sectarians, they thought: are you called a sectarian? Be it! Many donned defiant white robes, reminiscent of the clothes of sectarians from the White Brotherhood, only with the image of Sierpinski triangles. The column went down to Khreshchatyk, then to Podol, the embankment, and reached the Dnepr metro station. This is the route we love to walk along. Dnipro metro station is one of the least busy in the Kiev metro. Its passenger traffic set a record that day.

To create a brighter atmosphere of absurdity, the participants chanted slogans: "Freedom is slavery!", "Ignorance is power!", "War is peace!" Thus, they paid tribute to Orwell, a writer who understood what totalitarianism and unfreedom are. Yes, some facts in his biography raise questions, but no one says that life is easy. The world is complex.

The next day, the whole country knew about the Digital Reality Brotherhood.
