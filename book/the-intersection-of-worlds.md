# The intersection of worlds

Mikroslav and Ivan continued to take their walks, during which a stream of crazy information was flowing. This information, on the one hand, cut consciousness with its madness, on the other hand, like no other knowledge, explained this reality. And, most importantly, this information changed people's lives in a completely cardinal way, changed the lives of so many people, because this knowledge was needed by people, and knowledge needed people. Knowledge took care of them.

This time they walked along the ravines and along the winding streams of the "Dubki" park, which is near the "Syrets" metro station in the city of Kiev. The park cannot be called very well-groomed, sometimes there was rubbish, and the path through it was not always easy to go. Sometimes there were steep slopes, which were difficult to climb without proper preparation. Some areas were swampy, and the traveler ran the risk of getting bogged down knee-deep in the swamp. But most crucial, the park created an atmosphere of solitude, which is facilitated by the remoteness from civilization and people's houses.

They met on Saturday, early September. The weather became clearer, but cooler at the same time. This only contributed to the immersion in the endless world of Ideas. They passed under the railway bridge and turned left into the park. Soon they were walking along a large winding stream that formed meanders.

"Mikroslav, tell me, how isolated is the emulation of the Writer? How closely does its emulation interact with other emulations and Reality?"

Mikroslav, stepping over a small stream that fell into the main stream, found himself on a drier part of the path, stopped for a while, and began to say the following:

"The Emulation of the Writer is generally quite isolated. Other emulations and Reality have little influence on it. You could even say that they don't have it at all. Except for one aspect. Information or Knowledge. Thatâ€™s what appeared in the mind of the writer, and the fact that he later began to describe it in the form of text, happened for a reason. On the physical level, the intersection with other worlds was indirect, and sometimes looked quite comical."

The Writer lived in a house on the edge of the Goloseevsky forest. Its open spaces created a feeling of boundless green area, and this helped the Writer to move away from the hustle and bustle and create. The bustle of people generates an incessant flow of information, events, nonsense, and it is very important to be able to periodically move away from this. Sometimes it can be quite difficult, and then there is an even greater need to do this. Sometimes removal from the hustle and bustle does not happen by our will, but due to external circumstances, as, for example, in the case of a lockdown. But these are, rather, exceptions. However, some exceptions can have very fatal consequences.

The writer has been working as a programmer. One of the many ways to relax after a day of work, which he resorted to, was the contemplation of the surroundings through binoculars. As for the latter, I'll tell you in more detail.

Since the house is located on a hill, it is convenient and interesting to observe the space around it. And not only for people, how could you have thought, Ivan.

Ivan at that moment was passing another swampy area, and he did not have time to reflect on ironic thoughts. Suddenly he asked:

"Mikroslav, why do you place such an emphasis on binoculars and such strange habits of the Writer as ground observations? Is it important?"

"In general - no, except that one of the intersections of the worlds happened just during such an observation. Eventually, as the Writer could observe, the bulk of people in their behavior is very predictable, their daily routine is perfected. They go to work on schedule, eat on schedule, have sex on schedule, and finally die on schedule. This is the destiny of most people, and they deserve it in full."

Ivan's grin was becoming more and more obvious, despite the mud-stained sneakers. Mikroslav noted:

"No, as you might think, the Writer was not a fan of watching the hot evening scenes of his neighbors. He didn't give a damn about them. As if there is something original and intimate in their actions. No. More often this is the most mundane and mediocre, something that is repeated thousands of times a day for a million years. Now, if he had caught the shooting of hardcore porn, it would have been a different matter, at least, it would have been something off the beaten track. Okay, now we're off-topic."

The journey was long enough - they sat down on an old log. By four o'clock in the afternoon, the air warmed up a little, and staying in the lowland did not cause discomfort. Mikroslav continued:

"So, after a week of observations, the Writer lost interest in all of his observations: that of the landscape, which carried him away with its outlines, that of houses located many kilometers away from him. There was only one exception - one white spot that appeared a couple of times a week, somewhere on the sixth floor above, below the roof level, at a distance of 600 meters from it. It is sometimes more convenient to count floors from top to bottom."

Interest in this window was caused by the fact that in contrast to mediocre pastimes, such as eating, walking around the room, and sitting on the couch, in that window one could see a girl who was painting on a large easel.

She was of medium height with long blond hair. Behind her was a sofa adjacent to the window, on which a man often sat with a glass of amber-colored drink. He drank whiskey and looked at her picture. After a while, he disappeared. In the next window, the reflections of two binoculars eyepieces appeared, reflecting the lights of the city. The Writer was confused. Emulation creator was playing. He loves to do it. It was so funny how the Writer looks at himself...

Binoculars, telescopes are wonderful inventions. They make available what nature initially did not give access to. For thousands of years, people have been looking up into the sky and have been actually seeing a rather limited picture. Tools greatly change our perception of the world; significantly increase the strength of our interaction with it. And I'm not just talking about optical or electronic instruments. One of the most important tools, thanks to which one can strongly influence reality, is the idea and correct knowledge.

If we talk about the binoculars already mentioned, then in this case it played the role of a conductor between emulation and Reality. Although the writer stubbornly did not believe in it, did not admit it, but inside he felt that a big game was starting... The creator very rarely enters the emulation, but sometimes it happens.
