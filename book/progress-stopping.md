# Progress stopping

It was mid-September. They met at the exit of the "Polytechnic Institute" metro station. The scent of autumn intoxicated the mind. The crumbling chestnut leaves dangled underfoot. The cooling sun of the passing day illuminated Mikroslav's face, glittering with highlights on his brown leather jacket.

It was a free conversation of a philosophical nature. However, like many other conversations, this conversation, being an abstract object, influenced the lives of many people, moreover, generations.

Mikroslav and Ivan went up the road to the main building. Ivan looked through the messages on his phone:

"Ivan, stop fiddling with this primitive toy," Mikroslav exclaimed.

"Primitive? The power of this "toy" would be enough to launch a man to the moon and carry out all the most complex calculations that a man ever needed, somewhere up to the 80s."

“Human progress at the beginning of the 20s of the 21st century is significant,” Ivan objected.

They climbed up - a slight incline turned into a flat plain. They crossed the road and headed for the main building. Mikroslav shook his head:

"Yes, we have made some progress. Progress has been made and no one else has any intention of continuing it. And this causes insane sadness and anger."

Look at the building nearby. It is about 120 years old. Today is 2020. Can you feel how many events happened during this period? No, it's hard to list, not just keep in mind a list of dates, achievements, victories, or defeats during this time. Imagine yourself as a 120-year-old man who has retained a sober memory and sound mind. Try to feel the full power of the events of this period. You can’t, your heart can’t stand it.

Come on, I'll give you a more realistic challenge. Imagine that you were born in some small Russian village during the First World War, and managed to live until the end of the 90s. You were born and you had no electricity. There was no internet, no electricity, no planes. How far was space from you? Something that was ashamed to even dream of. After all, you simply did not have electricity. Machines appeared, flying "iron birds" or, to put it in a modern way, airplanes. Furthermore, the first manned flight into space - when a man in a little over an hour saw everyone who then inhabited the planet - appeared. Nuclear power - when from one kilogram of the required substance you can get the same amount of energy as from several tens of tons of coal. Computer Engineering - the calculations that all mankind would do for a year, a device with a small room can do in 1 second.

For you, this progress was almost magical. What a couple of decades ago was fantasy and magic became the technology of everyday life. Now you won't feel it. Progress has lost its former speed and will continue to lose it if nothing is changed globally. And this causes sincere indignation. This is more outrageous than anything else - more than ethical issues, global warming, the rights of various “oppressed ones” or anything else.

This causes genuine indignation. By the will of pure chance, that part of matter where your brain is located has the ability to be aware of itself, has the ability to communicate with other particles of the same matter, and, in the end, brings another part of matter into useful motion. And that's really cool. Stones can't do that. The flow of water cannot do that. Hares cannot do that. But people can. I don't know if God is in Reality. Probably not. Its existence is not necessary. But if there is a Sin, then the greatest sin is not attaining what you could achieve. No, I am not saying that it is necessary to work around the clock in the name of abstract progress. No. Progress is a concrete phenomenon. Everyone should do what is necessary. And then something will appear that is much larger than we are, something that delights, something that will amaze our consciousness with its depth, something that we cannot even imagine now.

Mikroslav and Ivan sat down on a bench near the entrance to the main building of the Polytechnic Institute. Mikroslav narrowed his eyes and continued in his expressive manner:

"I am outraged that we flush the potential of many worthy people down the toilet. Yes, the nature of people is such that the vast majority of them will not achieve anything special, will not be distinguished in anything, and will go into the abyss of time. But it's not about them. We are talking about the worthy. Perhaps someday the development of mankind will reach such a point that almost every member of society will create and generate. But in the coming decades and, perhaps, even a century, this should not be counted on. It is worth relying on those who can show the result. They will be able to lead everyone, and even those whose level of development leaves much to be desired."

Uniting the elite and concentrating efforts in the right direction are the most important tasks.

But let's return to our villager. He was born in a reality where there was no electricity, and died, in the days of the Internet, nuclear energy, and genetic engineering. At certain epochs, such a significant change could take centuries or even millennia. Seriously, what was the difference between Homo sapiens of the tenth millennium BC and the eighth millennium BC? The effect of the change is much less visible than the effect of change in the twentieth century. There have been more changes in a hundred years than in three thousand years. And it depends on a small group of people what the rate of change will be next.

Now we can only sadly note the gradual fading of progress. At first, it may not be noticeable, but later it will be more obvious. The abolition of slavery is progress, the right of women not to shave their armpits and walk in trousers is not progress, whether someone likes it or not. I don't care. The transition from a steam engine to an internal combustion engine or an electric motor is progress. The creation of a new smartphone model with the ability to transform a talking human face into a talking feces is illusory progress...

Initial successes can inspire and can create the appearance of continued development in the future. Unfortunately, this is not so. Everything is much more complicated and ambiguous. After the first victories in space and manned spacewalk, the landing of man on the moon, landing of flying vehicles on space objects in the solar system, and a number of other significant victories of the second half of the twentieth century, it seemed that the colonization of Mars, the Moon, Jupiter's moons was just a matter of a few decades. There was confidence that humans will meet, let's say, the year 2000, as the creatures that have visited Mars. Twenty or forty years have passed since those optimistic times. Still, there is no tangible result in these areas. Yes, now even a private company can launch a spacecraft into space. There have been a number of other important changes, but, turns out, this is not enough.

It was getting chilly. Ivan offered to take a walk. He listened attentively to what Mikroslav was saying. They gradually headed towards Yangel Street. Mikroslav asked thoughtfully:

"Do you think there are areas that inspire optimism now?"

Mikroslav could not contain a grin:

"First, today's society as a whole has abandoned the idea of ​​progress in the global sense of this word. This has ceased to be a real task for the elites, the government, and society as a whole. Human society began to fluctuate around a certain point, and the further - the smaller these fluctuations are. Directional development becomes less and less noticeable."

If we talk about some more specific things... Now in a progressive environment, we can talk about Moore's law, singularity, transhumanism... But what's the sense of talking about it? Moore's Law is slowing down. The frequency of processors stopped growing even earlier. The mass industrial application of new computer architectures that would significantly speed up computations or increase the amount of information storage is delayed.

If we talk about singularity, then the situation repeats itself like with space. They say that it will change soon, in 2025, 2035, 2045... Years go by, but nothing happens. Nothing will happen, and that is bad. People are interested in making porn in space, but they are not interested in how to double their lives. However, the example of porn and space is still not so bad. Instincts can be used for good. But when significant resources - time, money, attention are used for complete trifles - it is sad.

Previously, progress was largely stimulated by the Cold War because they knew that if your opponent is better equipped, you may well disappear - you will stop breathing, and your nation will stop taking place on the map. Yes, this is an old and not progressive idea, but it worked well.

Ivan and Mikroslav went down to the high-speed tram. Ivan gazed at the dormitory window on the left and soon asked:

"And why is this actually happening? After all, it is undeniable that the benefit for the species as a whole and for the individual in particular, which is more important, everyone decides for himself. It all depends on the personality. Everything, in the end, depends on the personality. Over time, the incessant technological progress will remove the restrictions of a person on movement, time of existence, thinking - as much as possible."

There was a moment's pause. Mikroslav thought hard, then answered:

"In fact, there are many reasons, but now I would note that to remove these restrictions, you need to apply too much effort, and the result of these efforts can be so far in the timeline that the vast majority of people find it easier to come to terms with the restrictions than do something against them. For them, the struggle with such restrictions seems to be nonsense, insanity, an attempt to scoop out the sea with a spoon. It may be so, but it is essential and, most importantly, it is fundamentally achievable."
