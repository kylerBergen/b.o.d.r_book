# The primary theses of The Brotherhood

It was July, there was a slight wind, and it was not too hot. Our travelers left for a nearby suburb - in Vyshgorod. They walked along the wide embankment. On the right was the so-called Kiev Sea - a vast reservoir with a lighthouse located on a narrow strip of land. On the left are picturesque hills. Mikroslav chirped about the Brotherhood and the Writer.

"Yes, since the Writer had no experience in writing a book, and initially, the book was rather crude, it was essential to express philosophy in simple language. Especially if the person who got to the resources of the Brotherhood was not ready to read long texts but could potentially help the Brotherhood, and the Brotherhood could be helpful to him. It doesn't always make sense to create complex things. Important things need to be created."

He reduced the entire philosophy of the Digital Reality Brotherhood to a few dozen theses, which, without being particularly puzzled, simply called them: "The main theses." It was in these theses about you and me. The very first version was as follows:

1. We and everything around us - people, nature, other planets, stars, and galaxies - is one colossal emulation, that is, a computer program. We live in a world that resembles a computer game. This world is virtual despite all its complexity and diversity.
2. There is no significant difference between our emulation and the real world. There is usually an almost unlimited number of emulations and their inhabitants, and those laws of physics that are valid for Reality are also valid for our emulation.
3. Reality exists - where emulations are created. And emulations can exist for an almost unlimited amount of time on the scale of the emulation itself.
4. At the moment, it is known that the connection between our emulation, other emulations, and Reality is insignificant, and we can assume that we exist practically in isolation and are left to ourselves with certain exceptions.
5. There is the Creator of Reality, about whom there is practically no information. There are Mikroslav and Ivan - people who live in a different emulation, which is almost identical to ours. Their conversations reveal the world order of emulations and ideas that are important for the Digital Reality Brotherhood. There is also the Writer who wrote a book about this system. At first, he assumed that he was writing a book of fiction but later began to understand that there is less fiction in this, and there is more reality in the described system than he would like.
6. The Digital Reality Brotherhood is a community of people aware that our world is virtual and emulation. The Brotherhood's goal is to create an environment of prosperity and happiness within this digital emulation.
7. Members of digital reality (for simplicity - "digitalists") are the intellectual part of society, whose life goals are self-development and activity in society's social, political and economic life.
8. A fundamental goal of the Digital Reality Brotherhood is to expand the circle of participants, popularize the movement and its development as a whole.
9. Personal self-development is the digitalist's way of life, and the fraternity will create an environment for creative self-expression, business contacts, and business creation.
10. Digitalists must help each other, improve themselves and others, and create a productive environment for the Digital Reality Brotherhood.
11. The Writer created the Brotherhood. He directs the movement, moderates.
12. The Brotherhood is flexible to the external environment and its changes but at the same time retains its principles in time and space.

Since the Writer did not have a large team - there were just a few of his friends and acquaintances who sometimes reread his book and gave their assessments, the process progressed slowly, and the quality of the text also wished for better. However, this ultimately was also in his favor - the reaction to the book was amazing, and the number of supporters was constantly growing.

Later, both the book and the theses were constantly changed, improved, supplemented, and rewritten. Theses provided an opportunity for both digitalists and people unfamiliar with the book to familiarize themselves with philosophy and draw conclusions quickly. Creativity was largely of a collective nature, which created a unique atmosphere, a special charm.

The main theses were supposed to reveal the features of the world order, the essence of the Digital Reality Brotherhood and how to live in a world where the world is a computer program.

"And who can make changes to the book, to the main theses?"

"Those who are close to these ideas, who understand their essence and understand how to improve the book, the main theses, the life of the brotherhood as a whole. Since the Writer was familiar with open source ideas, he posted the book on GitHub and other resources, where users could freely add and change the book's content. The Writer, as the creator of the project, was engaged in moderation."

Thanks to this approach, the book quickly got rid of typos and errors, and the book's quality overgrew. Translations into other languages began to appear. Because everyone could freely read and distribute the book, philosophy spread rapidly. And there were no barriers in the form of book publishers that could require changes in the book's content, or because of which the publication of the book could slow down for many months. And since the Writer himself was the moderator and organizer, the changes were of controlled nature, and later versions of the book did not distort the central philosophy of the movement but only supplemented and clarified it. In addition, the process of getting to know the Writer himself was gradual, and he laid out the materials as soon as they were ready. It didn't make sense to wait for a ready-made text of several hundred pages at once and could slow down the development of the Digital Reality Brotherhood.
