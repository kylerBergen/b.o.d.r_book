# Democracy doesn't work

The place of their next meeting was unremarkable. At first glance, the EU is an ordinary housing estate located 6 kilometers from the city center. If you try to describe this place in a few words, then nothing comes to mind except "average," "mediocre," "ordinary." Yes, the terms are different and even have different meanings, but it is between these meanings that the essence of Otradnoye lies. This place is neither good nor bad. It is ordinary, inhabited by ordinary people. There are new buildings with an average cost of apartments. There are outright ghettos near former factories, whose production has sunk into oblivion along with the empire that gave birth to them.

And there are thousands and thousands of such urban areas. Millions of people live in them. In such areas, in most cases, even if a person has not yet had time to be born, it is already known how much he will earn, whom he will vote for, how many children he will have, how many years he will live and what bad habits he will suffer.

And it should be noted that this is normal. It will not change; it will be so almost always. The average person, the person of the mass, is what will always surround us. The only thing he can change is to become more educated than his ancestors, but subconsciously, he will be drawn to mass culture and a simple ordinary life with all his gut. He will reject any significant changes, and he will even fight them.

It is possible and necessary to change the environment where such people live gradually, but they need to be given an understandable and chewed existence. By offering something too difficult for them to perceive, we offend their sense of dignity, cause confusion and rebellion in them. Therefore, it is useless, unnecessary, and harmful, both to those who are offered and those who are offering.

Of course, in any environment, separate individuals can achieve significant results. Still, they understand everything and, as a rule, after some time, move to a more fertile environment that contributes to development and prosperity.

They met at the high-speed tram stop and went to Otradny Park, located near the Aviation University. The morning rain, amid warm May weather, added a serene atmosphere that encouraged deep conversations.

"How do you like this area, Ivan? Are you still in favor of common suffrage?"

"Do you advocate totalitarianism and dictatorship?"

"I don't have an established opinion on this at the moment, Ivan. The regimes that existed in the 20th century, for example, in Germany, Italy, or Russia, ultimately oppressed human development and cannot be universal examples for building a state. Mass terror and murder are insane, and it should be the task of intelligent people to avoid this."

On the other hand, if you look at political life in the first half of the 21st century, democracy has become a fiction. This is a chimera; it seems to be there declaratively, on paper, but it has long been gone or not existed at all.

Stars, showpeople, and outright crooks began to come to power. And it's also good if they are backed by large business groups who manage them. But no, people began to appear among the heads of large European states who had no idea what a state was and how to govern it. Power degenerates into pure populism.

In short, democracy doesn't work. It harms those who can and should rule; they cannot get into power. At the same time, democracy also harms those who are ruled - the masses get heads who cannot lead. So this is a problem for everyone.

The choice of government is very responsible. I don't have a solution yet on how to do it better. I just want to touch on a few issues that stem from democracy and universal suffrage. Although I must note right away, I cannot oppose it now since its abolition could lead to totalitarianism.

When choosing the head of a company of a developed and already established business, they consider a person's experience, his moral qualities, assess his ability to build a strategy, and manage people in general. Conventionally, a person who does not understand technological processes in metallurgy does not have managerial experience and has been convicted of fraud or theft cannot be an executive director of a large metallurgical plant.

Complex systems should be managed by people who understand these systems and can build a workable vertical of power and monitor what is happening in the system under their leadership.

If we talk about governing the state, then there are few people capable of leading it, and the selection of such people through elections is clearly not very effective. For in the polls, the professor of economics, the thief who was convicted three times, and the homeless - have the same influence on the electoral process - one vote. That is, moral character, education, and income do not affect the electoral process.

Is this fair? Relatively yes, everyone is equal. Everyone can choose whoever they see fit. Is this correct? Probably not, because the choice is ineffective.

Besides, money still decides in the elections. If the candidate or the business group behind him has more resources than the other candidate, there is a significant chance that the first candidate will win. True, it is even worse when it is not money that wins but pure populism.
