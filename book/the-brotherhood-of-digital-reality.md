# The Brotherhood of Digital Reality

It was early June. 6 p.m. Mikroslav offered to meet in the lobby of the Dnipro metro station and asked Ivan to dress as simply as possible, in clothes that he doesn't mind getting dirty. Ivan was intrigued but decided not to ask unnecessary questions. Indeed there are special reasons for this.

Ivan arrived at 7 p.m., Mikroslav was 5 minutes late.

"Sorry, we had to collect our equipment, including the lanterns."

Ivan tensed.

"Lanterns?"

"Yes, where we are now, there is absolutely no light, except for what you bring with you."

Ivan began to guess where they were going. 

"Are we going underground?"

"Right. You asked me yesterday to tell you more about the emulation of the Writer after he published the book. I think this is an excellent place to do it. It will be easy for me to do it there."

They walked about a hundred meters from the metro and found themselves near an open sewer hatch, having climbed a small hill. Mikroslav happily remarked:

"Apparently, people have been here not very long ago, and we will not have to fiddle with a crowbar opening the hatch."

Mikroslav gave Ivan a flashlight, safety shoes to put on over his sneakers and quickly changed himself. After all the preparations, Mikroslav put on his flashlights and slipped underground.

They ended up in the so-called Nikolskaya system. This is one of the oldest underground structures in Kiev, built in 1916 during the Russian Empire.

Our travelers walked several meters through the trapezoidal tunnel and ended up in a small room. There was a fork into two tunnels - one dead end, reminiscent of a small metro, the second - a beautiful old brick tunnel, no more than one and a half meters high. They followed the second. Red and black streaks around small niches along the tunnel, stalactites, and the atmosphere of a medieval castle captured Ivan's imagination. The further they went, the more the rumble of the water was heard. Ivan asked what it was.

"Do not be afraid. As Kiev lovers of underground travel call this the so-called Tsar's well," Mikroslav answered.

After some time, they got out into the cascading gallery, in which they were finally able to walk to their full height. First, they went upstairs. Mikroslav showed Ivan the already mentioned Tsar's well. The view of the Tsar's well was breathtaking. It received water from the upper systems, which was poured here to prevent landslides. They were common in the hilly part of Kiev and could carry roads, houses, and trees.

The height of the Tsar's well is about 15-20 meters. The diameter is about 6. The main feature of the well was that it rained all year round at any time of the day, regardless of the weather. The stream of water at the top was evenly distributed and created the illusion of full-fledged rain. There were boulders of various sizes at the bottom of the well, which, like the walls of the well, were overgrown with growths.

After enjoying the view of the well, Ivan and Mikroslav went down the tunnel. After some time, they came out to the hall, which, unlike the gallery, had a significant height and width. In addition, it was level, not sloping like a gallery.

A simple bench was built in the hall with the help of several bricks and a board less than one and a half meters long, on which they sat down. Water rustled underfoot and went through a pipe about a meter in diameter into the Dnieper. Rumor has it that it is possible to get to the Dnieper after a while. In order not to disturb the old brick walls with electric light, Mikroslav lit a candle.

Mikroslav took out a beer because the drink was perfect for this underground atmosphere - in the literal and figurative sense of the word. Taking a sip, Mikroslav began to talk about the events that started to happen after the book was written, and they were genuinely remarkable.

"When the book was written, the Writer decided to create a small community around it, which would be united by the idea of the book and the values stated in it. Gradually, the community began to grow. More and more people came to it. There was no significant publicity. At first, few people knew about him, but interest in him grew every day."

"How fast did it grow?" Ivan clarified.

"It already depends on the emulation in which the Writer lives. It can potentially reach several thousand people both in a few months and in a few decades. And, by and large, it doesn't matter. The Writer was in no hurry. He did what he had to do. He did it because he could not do otherwise.

From the very beginning, the community began to function according to the principles that contributed to its development and helped its members get what they wanted.

"What was the name of this community?"

"The Brotherhood of Digital Reality. And the people who participated in it, for simplicity, were called digitalists, although they, in general, were not attached to the names."

The digital reality brotherhood had the features of a club of interests, religion, philosophy, a political party, and a business club. Everyone got what they needed from him. It quickly absorbed the best features of various groups of people - closed business clubs and ancient monastic orders, Jehovah's Witnesses and Scientologists, progressive political parties, and giant corporations.

The Brotherhood has turned into a platform for personal self-development, finding partners for business and life, and friends. People actively shared their experiences. A business community arose within the Brotherhood. One of the first such courses was programming. People were given knowledge, ignited with energy, and quickly got to their first job and moved up their careers even faster while working.

The Writer was engaged in organizational work. He was against pure charity. For him, it was a cross between ministry, work, and hobby. It inserted him. For the brotherhood management, he considered it fair to receive a contribution of 0.5% of income as a salary for keeping the Brotherhood in order. However, when his fortune exceeded a certain amount, this contribution went exclusively to the Brotherhood. In addition, everyone shared their experience, time, skills, and what they considered necessary with the fraternity. And this was not charity in the classical sense. It was an exchange. This community moved its members to the very top of the social hierarchy or created conditions for a quiet life without stress. Everyone got what they wanted.

The Brotherhood has turned into a full-fledged cultural project. At the time of the book's release and the creation of the first community, practically nothing existed. Those who came got a unique opportunity to create something incredible from scratch. It's like getting into Facebook or Google at the stage of creation. Such opportunities happen several times in life, and it is crucial not to miss them, which often people do because of the mask of irony and pride.

A vast number of creative people began to join the community. The Brotherhood created ample opportunities. Very cool creative content began to be generated: music, computer games, graphics, whatever. A new path has started for a large number of people. It was indeed a free path.
