# Leviathan's finest hour
Early October. Yellow-covered chestnut leaves lay under the feet of Mikroslav and Ivan. This time their meeting took place on Khreshchatyk. They went up towards the government district and Mariinsky Park. These places are associated in the minds of people with power. Those who has power over these Pechersk hills, has power over one of the areas of trust in Europe. The spirit of the state, its symbols were felt especially clearly here.

The conversation began with the Ivan's question:

"You wrote to me that today you want to tell something special and entertaining. For this I sacrificed cleaning my apartment and I hope I did it for a reason."

"Not in vain. There is no deception here, unlike another topic, where one total deception has been going on for more than six months. Moreover, as I say for sure, this is one of the most iconic hoaxes of the 21st century. This will clearly go into the textbooks. Like the Panama scandal or the Madoff scam. But this scam is clearly more ambitious and global. I'm talking about our "super dangerous" virus now."

Ivan with fatigue thought that he was facing another "covid-dissident" and objected to this.

"Do you think that the virus does not exist and that all this is an invention of scientists and the government?"

Mikroslav's breathing was a little lost, they climbed up the street.

"Of course the virus exists, people get sick with it, someone even dies from it. This is not about that. Here is another important thing. As in many other cases, it is not the event or phenomenon that is important here, but the reaction to this event or phenomenon. Sometimes the reaction to a phenomenon is more interesting than the phenomenon itself."

Here I will give you an example. You went to the country house. It is far from civilization and the connection is bad there. Suddenly you were bitten by a spider on your finger, there was a swelling, severe pain, and the skin turned yellow. You went to look on the Internet what to do and on the first link they tell you that these are symptoms of a deadly spider bite. There is nothing to do. You need to urgently cut off the affected limb until the poison spreads to the rest of the body and you die.

There is no steady connection, you are scared, your finger hurts badly. Panic begins. You are specifically scared for your life. And you just do as it is written in the article. Upon arrival in the city, it appeared spider was not at all fatal, although the manifestations of the bite are painful and frightening. You just had to wait. Your actions at the country house were useless/ The right thing at that moment was just to wait until the swelling subsided or to turn to medical help, if there was a possibility and there really was a need for it. Sometimes it really helps and removes the problem. But you did the wrong thing and lost your finger. Did you do the right thing then in the country house? No, cause have you ever seen  deadly spiders in your country house?

"This is nonsense," Ivan exclaimed.

"Yes, this is absolutely stupid. As well as locking the whole world at home, because you see, an infection has appeared with a mortality rate below 1% and which affects mainly the elderly population. This situation as the spider situation is equally silly."

"What do you think should have been done in that case?" Ivan asked with gradual understanding.

"It is intellectually dishonest to speak from the perspective of a person of today, a person of March 2020. It is necessary to clearly understand what information we then possessed and what we could then specifically undertake based on the data available at that time."

At the outset, I want to rightly point out that neither you nor I - we are not professional epidemiologists. We did not have the classified information that the government could have. We had only public information. And that was enough to make the right decision even at our level of awareness. We could then draw the right conclusions. Although, like the rest of society, we received data with a slight delay, we did not have much of the capabilities that the government had then. They could have made the right choice. They had the opportunity to make the right choice. But they didn't.

What have governments done? The governments that chose the masses decided to simply shut the people down like mad dogs at home, deciding what would be better for the people and what would not. By pure arbitrariness. Under the threat of huge fines.

And do you know what is most interesting? The insane toughness of the government's actions was of a global international character. The blocking was carried out by both countries that are considered democratic and quite authoritarian. Yes, some states tried to resist the corona-hysteria, but most of them eventually succumbed.

It doesn’t work like that to everyone stops the economy, destroying it, and you alone seem to be on the sidelines. This is not forgiven, this is harshly suppressed. The herd feeling is included at the state level.

Paradoxically, there was no blocking of the economy and public life in general in one of the most democratic countries in the world - Sweden, and in a country that in the minds of Western people is clearly not associated with democracy - Belarus. Although again, there are many questions about democracy as a political system, but we will talk about this at another meeting. Thus, in this case, extreme variants worked, it did not work to be "half democratic". And this is a rarity, that is, extreme options. In life there are more often semitones than contrasts. But sometimes contrasts are simply vital.

What could have been done if governments had acted rationally? Schools and universities could have been closed. It was possible to limit the movement of elderly people in public places on a voluntary basis to the maximum: you can walk anywhere, but if you are 85 years old, you must understand that you are at greater risk of dying of illness. It would be rational. In fact, the actions of the state were epic, grotesque, and absurd.

“Indeed, a number of restrictions, both in our country and even in very developed countries, did not make much sense,” Ivan confirmed.

"Yes, if we talk about Ukraine, the protection of the population from the coronavirus has degenerated into a real cargo cult, a fight with its own population and the destruction of its own economy."

For instance, what is about the ban on walking in the parks? The fact that, as the authorities themselves later admitted, there was no medical need for a ban on walking in parks, adds a special epicness to the main purpose of this ban - to intimidate its own population, so that it would sit at home in fear and understand the "seriousness of the situation." A great way to show strength and say that, you, people, are stupid, do not have the right to make decisions on your own, and we, the state, can pass any laws we want, completely spitting on the constitution. Who is strong is right. Introducing a fine for visiting the park in the amount of 1.5-2 monthly salaries is a good way to show people their place. For the sake of fairness, it should be noted that in countries like ours, the severity of laws is compensated by the non-obligation of their implementation. The population of other countries is less fortunate.

Remember, Ivan, you can work in peace, not bother anyone, pay taxes, and you still will be prohibited from going out to the park. Therefore, you need to be strong. You need to actively engage in business. You need to surround yourself with strong people. Become strong by yourself. Help your circle of people become strong. Don't be far from politics.

If we generally talk about the events of spring-summer 2020 in our country, then the actions of the authorities were not only stupid, but also inconsistent. Introducing a general quarantine when the number of infected is in units, and weakening it when the number of new infected is in the hundreds every day is the best way to show that the imposed strict quarantine was meaningless. The actions were copied in the most ridiculous way from other countries. This is a shame for 40 a million-strong country and shows the need for a genuine reform of the country's governance.

You know, the brutality of the state on the coronavirus issue can go too far, much further than you might initially imagine. In the emulation of the Writer and ours, which differs little from his one, the restrictive measures were not as harsh as in some other emulations. Although even in our emulation, they led to rather deplorable results and questioned the legitimacy of the state, the legitimacy of the then elite and the ability of the authorities to control the situation.

Ivan clarified:

"Maybe in that other emulation, the manifestations of the virus were more dangerous for the human body than in our emulation or emulation of the Writer?"

To this Mikroslav objected:

"Not at all. Let's talk about a virus as a medical problem, which has a set of specific properties - the level of lethality, contagiousness - the characteristics of the transmission of a particular virus from one organism to another, how actively it can be transmitted from one organism to another, from a patient to a healthy one. Then that emulation had practically the same coronavirus, but their reaction to it was quite different, which prompted one study."

This study was deeply mistaken not only in its results, but also in the very way it was carried out. If you do not go into details and briefly convey the essence, it happened as follows. 3-4 months after the start of the epidemic, in one third-rate scientific institution in Western Europe, a study was carried out on a person who died a few days before the start of the study. There were an absolutely horrible amount of errors in the research. I am not a doctor, I cannot explain all the details to you. The conclusion of the study was approximately the following: the coronavirus significantly damages the human body and even after a visible recovery, a person almost always dies after several months after infection. The first patients on the basis of which they made such a conclusion was an elderly Portuguese man of 88 years old with diabetes mellitus and astma. Later, the findings of this study were "tested" on several similar other patients.

At first, this "study" was known only within the organization in which the study was conducted, but soon it became known to journalists. The panic arose on a universal scale. In the context of the fact how long a person was contagious was not exactly known and the period, according to some sources, exceeded more than one month, there were calls to destroy those who had a positive test result. In underdeveloped countries, this appeal has become an action and part of national policy. In fact, genocide began there. A convincing refutation came only after about 3 months.

They stood on the observation deck in Mariinsky Park. The meeting was drawing to a close. Mikroslav, in the end, said the following: 

"You know, I am glad that thanks to this entire story, modern states and social institutions were able to fully manifest themselves. If, of course, a painful situation had not happened, people could have realized the nature of the state much later. The state has shown itself to be a creature that is not responsible for anything, longs for maximum power over the body and minds of people, but at the same time it is rather stupid."

Ivan noticed:

"You know, but people let it happen and in fact did not resist..."

"We will talk more about this at the next meeting," Mikroslav said.
